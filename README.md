This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in PHP related to loose comparison and handling null values in functions that perform addition.  The bug arises from PHP's loose comparison (`==`) which doesn't strictly enforce type checking.  The solution shows how to use strict comparison (`===`) to avoid such issues.  This bug is subtle and can be difficult to detect in larger applications.
